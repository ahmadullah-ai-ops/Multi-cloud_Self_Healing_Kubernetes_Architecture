# Multi-cloud Self Healing Kubernetes Architecture

Repository purpose
- Provision Kubernetes clusters on **AWS (EKS)** and **Azure (AKS)** using Terraform.
- Deploy a demo microservice (`nginx:stable`) to both clusters.
- Provide a **self-healer** (Kubernetes CronJob) that checks application health and restarts/rolls deployments if unhealthy.
- CI/CD via **Jenkins**: runs Terraform, deploys k8s manifests, monitors health, and triggers self-heal actions if required.

Important
- This repo is a demo/boilerplate. You must provide cloud credentials and adjust variables before running your own.
- The demo app uses `nginx:stable` --- no image build required.

Quick Workflow
1. Set cloud credentials (AWS & Azure).
2. `cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply` (see variables).
3. Configure kubeconfigs (outputs will show how).
4. Run `kubectl apply -f k8s/base/` on both clusters (or let the Jenkins do it).
5. Install Jenkins and configure pipeline using `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.
6. Monitor self-healer CronJob in each cluster.

Contents
- `terraform/` : infra code for EKS (terraform-aws-modules recommended) and AKS (azurerm).
- `k8s/` : manifests for nginx:stable deployment + HPA + self-healer CronJob.
- `jenkins/` : Jenkinsfile for CI/CD.

Notes on self-healing design
- Uses native Kubernetes features (liveness/readiness probes, HPA, PDB).
- Adds a CronJob that runs a lightweight script to check app endpoints and perform `kubectl rollout restart` or scale operations if unhealthy.
- Jenkins pipeline orchestrates terraform -> apply manifests -> verify -> force redeploy.

Security & Production considerations
- Use secure secret storage for kubeconfigs (Jenkins credentials store / vault).
- For global traffic failover in production use a managed/global load balancer (e.g., Route 53 with health checks or cloud traffic manager).
- Use private clusters, RBAC, and network policies for hardening.

# Multi-Cloud Self-Healing Kubernetes Architecture  
*A Journey Beyond Automation*  
 

Most DevOps engineers today are proud of their automated pipelines. The CI/CD runs smoothly, clusters deploy on demand, and infrastructure stands tall on Terraform’s foundation.  

But here’s the reality no one admits easily, automation alone isn’t resilience.  
You can automate deployments, but you can’t automate trust. You can provision clusters, but you can’t always prevent failures.  

In the world of modern cloud operations, one silent truth echoes through every on-call night: *Even automated systems fail, what matters is how fast they heal.*  

That’s where this project was born, **Multi-Cloud Self-Healing Kubernetes Architecture**, designed to run seamlessly on **AWS EKS** and **Azure AKS**, provisioned with **Terraform**, and integrated through a **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline**.  

This is not just another infrastructure demo. It’s an exploration into what truly makes a system resilient, and why multi-cloud, self-healing systems are the next evolution in DevOps thinking.

## The Problem: Cloud Complexity and Human Dependency  

Every engineer who’s managed production knows this pain:  
- A pod crashes at 2 AM, metrics spike, and the alert doesn’t trigger.  
- One region goes down, and all your "high availability" claims fade in minutes.  
- A deployment misconfiguration takes the app offline, and you wish you had rollback logic already tested.  

Even with autoscaling and failover, there’s often a hidden human bottleneck. We fix things manually that systems should fix themselves.  

This project’s goal was to eliminate that dependency, to design an ecosystem where Kubernetes heals itself automatically across clouds while developers sleep peacefully.  

---

## The Vision: A Self-Healing Cloud Ecosystem  

Imagine this:  
- Your application crashes due to a memory leak. Within seconds, a **Kubernetes CronJob** detects the unhealthy pod and restarts it.  
- Traffic surges suddenly on one cloud. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** scales your workload instantly, while **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)** ensure stability.  
- Terraform provisions infrastructure on both **EKS** and **AKS** environments, allowing workloads to shift dynamically if one cloud faces downtime.  

And above all, **Jenkins CI/CD** automates every step, from infrastructure creation to deployment to health validation, leaving no room for manual drift.

## Key Components  

### 1. Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
Terraform acts as the single source of truth. With one command, both AWS and Azure clusters can be provisioned, ensuring consistent environments across clouds.  
Modules are reusable, variables are standardized, and outputs integrate seamlessly with Jenkins pipelines.  

### 2. Jenkins for CI/CD Automation  
Jenkins pipelines handle deployment automation. Every code change triggers:  
- Terraform provisioning or update.  
- Docker build using the **Nginx:stable** image (demo app).  
- Kubernetes deployment validation across clusters.  

The pipeline doesn’t just deploy, it verifies, monitors, and ensures compliance.  

### 3. Kubernetes Self-Healing Layer  
A dedicated **self-healer CronJob** runs at intervals.  
It executes `check_and_repair.sh`, which:  
- Scans for failed pods and deployments.  
- Restarts unhealthy containers.  
- Logs every action for audit trails.  

It’s Kubernetes watching over itself, a concept that bridges DevOps and AI-Ops thinking.  

### 4. Multi-Cloud Flexibility  
The architecture supports both **EKS** and **AKS**, controlled by a single variable in `main.tf`.  
It offers a real-world demonstration of multi-cloud resilience when one provider falters, the other sustains.

## Real-World Relevance  

Gartner predicts that by **2027**, 70% of global organizations will adopt a multi-cloud strategy to avoid vendor lock-in.  
But here’s the catch, multi-cloud without self-healing is just multi-failure.  

The modern enterprise needs infrastructure that can adapt, heal, and evolve on its own, because downtime is no longer just a technical failure, it’s a business loss.  

This architecture helps DevOps teams reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR) from hours to minutes by automating failure detection and correction.  

---

## Lessons from Building It  

1. **Simplicity beats sophistication**  
   Using Nginx as a demo image may seem basic, but it keeps focus on the resilience logic, not the application complexity.  

2. **Observability drives healing**  
   Self-healing begins with knowing what’s broken. Without proper metrics and health checks, automation is blind.  

3. **Multi-cloud is a mindset**  
   It’s not about spreading workloads, it’s about designing for independence so no single failure ever brings you down.  

4. **Jenkins still matters**  
   Despite modern tools like GitHub Actions or ArgoCD, Jenkins remains a battle-tested CI/CD backbone for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

## The Future: Toward Autonomous Cloud Operations  

This project is just a step toward something bigger, autonomous cloud ecosystems powered by AI-driven decision-making.  
Imagine a world where the cluster not only heals but learns, where failures teach the system how to prevent them next time.  

That’s the path from *DevOps* to *AI-Ops*, and it starts with architectures like this.  

---

## Final Thought  

In DevOps, true mastery isn’t in deploying faster, it’s in recovering smarter.  
The **Multi-Cloud Self-Healing Kubernetes Architecture** represents more than automation, it’s a philosophy of reliability, trust, and evolution.  

Because at the end of the day, a resilient system isn’t one that never breaks, it’s one that always finds a way to rise again.
